    <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
            Welcome to My Music Platform, your personal space to host and share my music with the world. This platform is built with a passion for music and a desire to provide a simple, clean, and effective way to manage and showcase my audio creations.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">My Vision & What I'm Building</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            My journey into creating this platform stems from a deep love for music and a desire to have a direct, independent space for my work. While the dream of a global distribution platform like DistroKid is a long-term aspiration, this current project is focused on building a solid foundation for my own musical presence online. It's about learning, experimenting, and mastering the technologies involved in web development and digital audio.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Currently, this platform serves as my personal music library, allowing me to upload, organize, and share my tracks directly with you, my audience. It's designed to be intuitive and focused purely on the music.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">The Tech Behind the Music</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            This website is powered by:
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>**Python Flask:** A lightweight and flexible web framework that handles all the backend logic, including file uploads, database management (using SQLite), and serving web pages.</li>
                <li>**Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid and responsive UI development, ensuring the platform looks great on any device, from mobile phones to desktop computers.</li>
                <li>**HTML & JavaScript:** The foundational languages for structuring and adding interactivity to the web pages.</li>
            </ul>
            Every line of code is a step in my learning journey, pushing the boundaries of what I can create as a solo developer.
        </p>

            [Here, you can write a short paragraph or two about yourself, WILBER ON BEATZ. For example:]

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Future Aspirations</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            While this platform starts as a personal project, I envision it growing into something more. My long-term goal is to continue expanding its features, perhaps adding more advanced discovery tools, user profiles, or even exploring ways to support other independent artists in the future. Every step is a learning opportunity towards realizing that broader vision.
